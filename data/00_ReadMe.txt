# Description 
This dataset contains a list of 423 consumer-based wrist-worn activity trackers and smart watches, capable of collecting and estimating physical activity levels in individuals, using accelerometer and other sensors. 
For each device, 12 attributes are included. See list bellow (column headers). 

# Method
Data were collected by automatic and manual searches through six online and offline databases, as well as manual collecting of data from company web sites. Data was collected in 2017, and contains all identified devices released between 2011 (earliest identified device) and July 2017. For each device 12 attributes were collected. See list below (variables).
